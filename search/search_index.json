The first one is to generate a board with some random numbers and positions, then try if the Sudoku is solvable. The second one is to have a fully solved board, then remove numbers randomly.</p> <p>This generator takes the second approach, where it is still needed to generate a fully solved board. By completely ignoring hardcoding one solved board, it is crucial to understand the mathematics of the board to be able to generate a new board.</p> <p>Considering a Sudoku board as an $M*N$ board, stating that $M$ (number or rows) and $N$ (number of columns) can be greater, equal or lower than 9; it is definet the number $k$ that defines the maximum value for the numbers to be placed in a row, column or mayor square.</p> <p>$$ k = M * N $$</p> <p>Considering the grid that corresponds to the Sudoku board, each minor cell is defined by the matrix coordinates $r$ (row) and $c$ (column), both 0-indexed.
